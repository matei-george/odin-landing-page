# The Project52 Landing Page Project

This is my solution to **The Odin Landing Page** project, another one, this time of a much bigger complexity and size than **Odin recipes**.

The project is build mostly using CSS Flexbox. It provided me a lot more knowledge regarding how to code better, how to use better markup, how and when to use CSS Flexbox and what properties to use, and most importantly, why.

## Technologies used :

Throughout this project I used the following technologies :

-  HTML
-  CSS
-  CSS Flexbox
-  CSS transition for buttons and links

## Summary

This project taught me a lot. It took way longer than last time, but it was well worth it. I know it needs improvement, quite a lot since the markup is kind of a big spaghetti bowl, and some usage of Flexbox was really unnecessary, but I will gather more knowledge as I code along and come back to it when I have a lot more experience. I'm not that great **yet**.

Hope you enjoy it still. This was a couple of hours of work, but I'm satisfied with what I've done and I'm excited to go on to the next one.
